For this post I would like to focus on media objects. In the world of CSS there is a concept of atoms and molecules. As in real life these are the building blocks that help us create life.

We've also added a lot of different settings for [Redcarpet][redcarpet],
including being able to ^superscript, _underline_, ==highlight==,
~~strikethrough~~, and footnotes.[^1] It even automatically makes links into
URLs: www.jekyllrb.com and you can put multiple underscores in words without
them leaning all over the place: this_word_has_underscores. It'll also make your
quotes look nice, like this: "hoho", your dashes and hypens will be dashing too:
---/--.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of
Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].
