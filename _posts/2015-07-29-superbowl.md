### Description Half time is GAME TIME

The Superbowl was in Phoenix AZ in 2015 and I made this site in dedication of the big day. This site was made to be totally responsive. The video player on the site was created using the HTML5 tag. Forms, as many of you know, can be a bit tricky to style and place in the correct locations. Since this page was created I have practiced many a form and I can create forms with much more easy. You can not tell from these images but there is also some transitions and transforms at play here.
