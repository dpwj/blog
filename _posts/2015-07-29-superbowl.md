### Description Half time is GAME TIME

The Superbowl was in Phoenix AZ in 2015 and I made this site in dedication of the big day. This site was made to be totally responsive. The video player on the site was created using the HTML5 <video> tag. Forms, as many of you know, can be a bit tricky to style and place in the correct locations. Since this page was created I have practiced many a form and I can create forms with much more easy. You can not tell from these images but there is also some transitions and transforms at play here.
