### Description

This is a 6 week marketing campaign  for Arizona State Credit Union. The sole goal for the team was that the customers would see what the potential prizes were and how to participate in the program. I was requested to work on this through Cramer-Krasselt Advertising Agency based in Phoenix AZ. 

The tools used to complete the project were Yeoman, Gulp, SASS, and HTML.
