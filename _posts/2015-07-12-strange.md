This Yeoman is not the same as the one you can find in the history books. This Yeoman is a large repository of different types of code scaffoldings. This platform allows developers to set-up their development environment for a particular project and then post the basis of the code to Yeoman for the purpose of reusing it. 

The idea of resuing code templates is to speed up the set-up time and shorten the overall development period. Yeoman comes in handy most when a developer is needing to start a project from scratch. 


### How to use Yeoman 

Like most anything in the developer world, Yeoman is a NPM module that is very easy to install. You just pick out a "code generator" (that is yoeman speak for scaffolding/ code framework). There are over 2,000 different types of Yeoman code generators. Once you decide which code generator to use, type 'yo (code generator)' and yoeman will walk you through the rest.
