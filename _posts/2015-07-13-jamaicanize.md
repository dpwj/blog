for a beginning developer the best way to learn how to layout a website is to Jamaicanize a layout. Jamaicanizing is the process of giving every single element you build a different background color. This creates a brightly colored crazy looking layout. While this may seem counter intuitive and like a lot of extra work, it is not. Once you have completed the layout it is very quick and easy to take the background colors away. 

This process will show you exactly where each element is located and help you understand the css properties that are at play. 

There are many situations in css that are hard to understand if you are not able to visualize.
- collapsing margins
- box model
- floats
- position absolute/relative
- flexbox

These are just a few of the tricky situations you can find yourself in as a new developer. Once you start understanding how to layout pages you can easy up on the crazy Jamaicanize decoration if you dare.
