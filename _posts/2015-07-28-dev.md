This day and age people find themselves emersed in a world of technology. It is everywhere from your phone, watch, computer, car, and even some kitchen appliances. The more and more we crank out technology the more people that we will need to help maintain it all. Someone has to write programs for all of it and make sure everything is cutting edge.

Have you found yourself in search of a new career? Are you feed up with your current position in life and want to do something better for yourself? You may have noticed that the technology industry is paying really well and is short staffed. 

If you are someone that like to solve problems and always be learning something new and inovative, someone who strives to work hard at all things in life, and someone who truely loves technology being a Web Developer is a good choice for you. 

I feel really lucky to be a part of such a great community of people. In Development there are always people working on new and creative things. There is always improvements to be made to the existing way of doing things. Most developers contribute to the large community by mentoring people, answering technical questions online or developing software for open source code. By doing this it just strengthens the group as a whole and makes everyone better.
