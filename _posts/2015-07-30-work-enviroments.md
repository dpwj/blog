What do most people consider a great place to work? 

<!--more-->

These days you hear that companies are all about the culture. I believe that it is just a workplace buzzword for this generation. People back in the 50s did not even thing about the culture in which they worked. It is was just a place you punched the clock. 

## Two Different Types of "Cultures"

#### Relaxed

There are many different styles and types of company culture. Each company has their own type of eco system they like to operate in. As far as the technical - start up community goes, they generally claim to be laid, back relaxed, and fun. They boast about all the ammenities of working at the company. I got the opportunity to follow a few developers around at a tech start up in Phoenix and the atmostphere was very relaxed.  


#### Coporate "Culture"

Coporate culture is usually one that focuses on the bottom line and getting things done. They tend to be a part of large companies that have a very rigid structure. On average the coporate group tends to have a dress code and more regular hours. 


Most people align themselves with one or the other and really do not like to be apart of the opposing side. It is good that there are different options for all the differing personalities that are out there.
