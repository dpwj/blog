GULP OR GRUNT? Who? What are those? Let's take a little deeper look into what a build tool is and explore the world of MAGIC code helpers.

<!--more-->
A Build tool is some piece of software that allows you to do something to your code after you are done writting it. There are lots of different functions a build tool can help with. Both Grunt and Gulp have large libraries that can help you accomplish many different tasks. 

 - Clean ~ removes a file or folder
 - Concatinate ~ adds multiple files into one large file
 - Minification ~ takes out all of the white spaces to make the file as small and compact as possible. This is supposed to help greatly with the speed the code can run. 
 - Autoprefixer ~ This adds code to your existing code that will help your code run the same way in the different browsers. It adds the browser prefixes where needed without you haveing to do anything more than just run that build tool. 
 - SASS ~ Turns a sass file into a css file. 
 - Watch ~ This process looks at a file and runs certain code everytime something is changed.

GRUNT - older build tool that uses large JSON files to configure your build process. These files tend to be very lengthy because each item has it's own line. This way of doing things usualy promotes the structure and ease of understanding. This program runs in a synchronous fashion by default. The way grunt works is 


GULP - This is a newcomer ot he build process party. Gulp is an asynchronous way to build things. This code is more about writing code and less about the rigid structure. Gulp is able to read multiple files at the same time and stream them. 


You can customize and work with both processes. However Gulp tends to be more popular as of late and is my choice for the best build tool on the market at the moment. Plus it was started in Phoenix and I like to support local development.
