I have recently noticed that many a developer has a strong connection to the code that he/she uses. One way they show it is buy purchasing stickers shpaed like the logo of thier favorite or most used code. This is quite fun a very easy way to announce what code you use and what style of developer you are. I suggest keeping up to date and promote code that truely support whole heartedly. This is a very similar process to those who get a Tatoo. While stickers are not as permanent but just as bold a statement to others. Choose wisely my friends.
